## Description

ThoughtHub is a backend API that powers a social networking platform where users can create an account, share their thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and manage a list of friends. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDBCompass, and Mongoose, this project provides a solid foundation for scalable social media applications. The API supports full CRUD operations for users and thoughts connections. Reactions and friend support Create and Delete connections.
